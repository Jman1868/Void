## ***About***
This is a small little project I made while learning about React. The user can type something or just hit submit for a random quote to appear. After following a tutorial series I figured making a project on my own would be a good way to solidify the concepts I learned.

 - Used useseffect to handel an api request
 - Created different components and utilized reacts dynamic rendering
 - Used nextjs to create project and learn about its workflow

## ***Design***

I really wanted to create a sort of mono chromatic look so I spent some time in figma and created a design I really liked.
